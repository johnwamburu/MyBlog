I am a Computer Science PhD Student at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, advised by Professor Prashant Shenoy.

In my previous life, I was a software engineer at IBM.

My research is in Systems, particularly in intelligent transportation systems.

My undergraduate degree is in Software Engineering.

If I were to rank my languages, Python would be first - then Java, C, C++.
