I am a software engineer at IBM.

If I were to rank my languages, Python would be first - then Java, Scala, C, C++.

I have a degree in Software Engineering - they actually let me graduate top of that class.

I am currently doing an M.Sc. in Computer Science (At Gatech)

I like scaling challenges, high performance computing architectures, and analyzing enormous amounts of data with Machine Learning.

I respond to [email](mailto:jwamburu@gatech.edu) faster than [Twitter](http://twitter.com/johnwamburu){:target="_blank"}.

My open source contributions can be found on [Github](http://github.com/johnwamburu){:target="_blank"}.

I also have a profile on [LinkedIn](https://ke.linkedin.com/in/johnwamburu){:target="_blank"}.
