I am a software engineer at IBM.

If I were to rank my languages, Python would be first - then Java, Scala, C, C++.

I have a degree in Software Engineering - they actually let me graduate top of that class.

I am taking a Masters in Computer Science (At Gatech).

I like scaling challenges and high performance computing architectures. A lot.

I tend to respond to [email](mailto:jwamburu@gatech.edu) within 24 hours.

My open source contributions can be found on [Github](http://github.com/jwamburu){:target="_blank"}.

I also have a profile on [LinkedIn](https://ke.linkedin.com/in/johnwamburu){:target="_blank"}.
